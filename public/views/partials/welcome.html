      For the past 2 years I have been chair of the Lowry Hill East Neighborhood Open Spaces Committee. I spearheaded
      the development of one of Minneapolis' first parklets in the CARAG neighborhood. I have a degree in English from
      Pacific Lutheran University and a masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the Humphrey School of Public
      Affairs.

      Hi, my name is Jono! I am an urban planner, proud South High graduate, and a product of our parks. I do
      community-based engagement, planning, and research work for a wide array of public, private, and non-profit
      organizations in the Twin Cities.

        <strong>Parks for and by the people.</strong> Let’s empower local stewardship of our parks, by allowing more
        local, active participation in bettering our parks, moving towards participatory budgeting, and creating
        meaningful partnerships with community groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Safe parks are active parks.</strong> We should be spending more money on youth programming than we do
        on police enforcement, not the other way around.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be bold stewards of our environment</strong> to combat climate change. Let’s invest in rain gardens,
        carbon sequestration, and end the use of pesticides in the parks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weave an equity framework through all park decisions.</strong> I am well-versed in performing equity and
        policy analyses. I wrote a transformative equity-based study on capital budget spending in Saint Paul that
        spurred an overhaul of the entire spending process. I will bring this perspective to evaluating all our park
        spending.
